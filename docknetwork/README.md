# Docknetwork/crypto

This directory contains a PoC which shows how the different
proofs WP3..WP6 can be created using the docknetwork
library.
Currently it is based on four rust tests which run the
different proofs.

Once you installed [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing-devbox/index),
you can run the experiment with the following command:

```bash
devbox run dock-all
```

The resulting time will be stored in a file called `stats.csv`.
