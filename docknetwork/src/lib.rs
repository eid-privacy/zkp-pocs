//! This is a simple implementation of the work done by Ubique using
//! ZKattest to prove that an ECDSA signature can be verified using a commitment
//! on a public key stored in a BBS credential.
//!
//! The test at the end shows how to set up a system and check that the verification
//! is correct.
//! For a longer explanation, see our [Github Repo](https://github.com/c4dt/how-2025-06-eID)
//! with Jupyter notebooks and more information.
//!
//! WARNING: This is a work of a couple of days for a hands-on workshop.
//! While the general gist of how keys are generated, signatures created and verified,
//! ZKP written and verified is correct, I'm sure that there are:
//!
//! - errors in this re-arrangement of @Lovesh's excellent work from
//! [docknetwork/crypt](https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/blob/main/equality_across_groups/src/pok_ecdsa_pubkey.rs#L462)
//! - not optimal and not secure ways of treating private keys and other random secrets
//! - commitment - BBS proof: nonce and context are static - it could directly integrate the
//! revealed values in the proof.
//!
//! So while this work has been done to the best of my knowledge, I definietly took a lot
//! of shortcuts and definitely valued simplicity for a hands-on-workshop over cryptographic
//! correctness.
//!
//! May [Rogaway, Chaum and Goldwasser](https://politics.media.mit.edu/papers/Rogoway_Moral_Cryptography.pdf)
//! have mercy on me :)
